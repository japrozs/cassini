# Cassini

`Cassini` is an emulation tool for space rovers. It emulates the launch, travel, and landing of rovers on different planets.

## Usage

```bash
# clone the repo
# cd into the repo
$ make
$ ./bin/csn
```

To change the planets or rovers, edir (src/main.c)[src/main.c] and change the rover name and planet name appropriately.
